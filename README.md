# Box-Technical-Assessment

This app is designed to be viewed on the iPhone 7/8 Plus. I would show the demo in the meeting on my personal device (iPhone 7 plus) and if it is necessary to show on other devices I would add dynamic sizing to the application. However, for the purposes of this project I did not implement dynamic sizing as it is on my personal device.

My video shows a Bank of America employee logging into the Box portal, opening the loan applications folder and seeing the client's uploaded file. However, it does not show the employee opening the file because I have been getting an error saying "We're sorry, we can't preview this file type in your web browser. To view this content please download and open it on your device." I did some reasearch and it seems like this is most likely due to the fact that I do not have a business level box account, so I am unable to actually view the content.
